A large number of students along with their friends come and enjoy the luxury of watching their favourite movie with each other under the roof of open sky. In the night, it also serves as a wonderful place where people can have a peaceful heart to heart talk while watching the beautiful star-lit sky. And to add to more fun, there is also a food court where food is available 22.5 hours of the day. It has shops vending snacks, rolls, dosas etc. Many birthday parties are held here.

The first two sections, easy and medium, are of 2 meters and the difficult section is of 2.85 meters making total span of the wall 6.85 meters. </p>
